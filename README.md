# uc3m Networks Workshop 2025
Methods Workshop: Social Sciences PhD Program (2025/2026). Network Theory for the Social Sciences: Concepts, Models, and Applications with Python

## How to use this material (no git needed)

### 1. Create your personal workspace

On your computer, create a folder, for example:

`my_workshop_work/`

You will keep all your work there.

### 2. Each session

1. Go to this GitHub page.
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**.
3. Unzip the file (you'll get a copy of this repository with folders named `session_X/`).
4. Inside, identify the Jupyter notebook, for example `uc3m_networks_workshop_2025/session_1/introduction_to_networks.ipynb`.
5. Copy all `session_X` folder that session folder into your workspace, so you have:

   `my_course_work/session_1/introduction_to_networks.ipynb`
   `my_course_work/session_1/extras/`
   `my_course_work/session_1/data/`

6. Work **only** inside the folder in `my_course_work/` (not in the downloaded ZIP folder).

### 3. If I publish an update for the current session

Sometimes I may update data or example code for the current session.

- I will **not** change the files you are supposed to edit.
- I will only update helper files in `extras/`.

To update:

1. Delete de old downloaded ZIP.
2. Download the ZIP again.
3. Unzip it.
4. Copy the updated files from `session_X/extras/` and `session_X/data/` 
   into your corresponding folder in `my_course_work/session_X/extras/` and `data`,
   overwriting the old extras and data.
