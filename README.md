# uc3m Networks Workshop 2025
*Methods Workshop: Social Sciences PhD Program (2025/2026)* <br>

Welcome to the Workshop for Network Theory for the Social Sciences: Concepts, Models, and Applications with Python :)

Networks are all about connections. By focusing on relationships rather than isolated units, we can understand structures and patterns of real-world complex systems. You'll see that more things than you can imagine can be represented as a network, and we'll be able to understand many social, biological, and technological phenomena not only from individual characteristics but from the web of interactions that link them.

This workshop will introduce participants to the foundational concepts and theories of networks in the social sciences and show how these frameworks help explain individual behaviors and collective outcomes. We will examine how network structures help explain social, political, economic, and cultural dynamics; learn to visualize and analyze networks using Python; and connect empirical patterns to social theory. By the end, participants will also understand the principles behind generative and statistical models of social networks and how to apply them in practice.

## Workshop contents
You can find a detailed syllabus of the course [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tbUFCsfmJMqQ1RelFVrBqFgI3F6eA9p0Fdt3vsGC9LE/edit?usp=sharing). We will have one session per week and, for each session, I'll update this repository with its corresponding material, which will consist of a theoretical part (through slides) and a practical part (through Jupyter notebooks). You can find instructions on how to set up Python and Jupyter notebooks in the syllabus.

The material is divided as follows:
1. **Introduction to networks and Python** ([slides](https://blas-ko.github.io/uc3m_networks_workshop_2025/session_1/01_introduction_to_networks_and_python_slides.pdf), [tutorial (viewer)](https://blas-ko.github.io/uc3m_networks_workshop_2025/session_1/01_introduction_to_networks_and_python.html), [session folder](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/blas-ko/uc3m_networks_workshop_2025/tree/main/session_1))
2. **Network models and structural analysis**
3. **Link prediction and network inference**
4. **Dynamics on networks**
